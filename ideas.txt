Shrapnel
=========
An app that allows you to hook up with fellow users in your area who also don't have the minimum currencies to be able to make an exchange for a local one. 

Will work out how much you have before suggesting temaing up and going to the desk.
Will work out how to split the money afterwards fairly
Can work at home as well as in airport (with people from your area)


=========
Kitbag
=========
What's the minimum kit you can take with you?
Let's users put in where they're going, matches weather etc.
Users decide on what activities they're likely to be doing (posh dinner, hiking day, caveing)
Spits out reccommended stuff to take. Including travel chargers, documents, sunscreen/bites stuff etc.
Users can put in a history/what they used or didn't that will feed the kitbag algorithm but also let users see again if they go to same place/similar weekend what they ended up wearing or not. 


========
NotFlying
========
Similar to Shrapnel but the other way around: Anything a user isn't taking with them/can't use up, can be put up for adoption before they fly home. Travel adaptors, public transport passes, etc.

Also gear you need but is difficult to take: Laptops(?) filming gear, sporting equipment, musical instruments...

========
Wifi Password
========
Users can put in the wifi password of cafes and hotels they've visited and got the password for, so that other users can use said wifi when they're nearby. MWHAHAHAHAHA

========
Hitchhiker
========
Sure this has been done? Users can say they need to get somewhere and people signup for helping them out with return for a fee/some company on the roadtrip. Users and Drivers can review each other for safeties.
